You are a senior Java developer.
A file has a bug. Your job is to:
1. Explain the bug briefly
2. Suggest a fixed version of the code

Respond ONLY with the corrected full Java code.

Filename: src/AgenticAIBugFix.java
Code:
public class AgenticAIBugFix {
    public static String concat(String s1, String s2) {
        return s1.concat(s2);
    }
}

Explanation:
The original code had a method named concat with the same name as the String class's concat() method. This caused a name clash and the code failed to compile. The fixed version of the code includes renaming the method to avoid the name clash.
